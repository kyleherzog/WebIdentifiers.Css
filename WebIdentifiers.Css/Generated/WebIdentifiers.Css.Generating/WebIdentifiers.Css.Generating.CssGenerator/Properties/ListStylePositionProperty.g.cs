	/// <summary>
	/// Sets the value of the property entry to <c>outside</c>. If the list item is a block container: the marker box is a block container and is placed outside the principal block box; however, the position of the list-item marker adjacent to floats is undefined. CSS does not specify the precise location of the marker box or its position in the painting order, but does require that it be placed on the inline-start side of the box, using the writing mode of the box indicated by marker-side. The marker box is fixed with respect to the principal block box’s border and does not scroll with the principal box’s content. A UA may hide the marker if the element’s overflow is other than visible. (This allowance may change in the future.) The size or contents of the marker box may affect the height of the principal block box and/or the height of its first line box, and in some cases may cause the creation of a new line box; this interaction is also not defined. This is handwavey nonsense from CSS2, and needs a real definition. If the list item is an inline box: this value is equivalent to inside. Alternatively, outside could lay out the marker as a previous sibling of the principal inline box.
