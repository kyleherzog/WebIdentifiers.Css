	/// Sets the value of the property entry to <c>arcs</c>. An arcs corner is used to join path segments. The arcs shape is formed by extending the outer edges of the stroke at the join point with arcs that have the same curvature as the outer edges at the join point.

	/// <summary>
	/// Sets the value of the property entry to <c>crop</c>. The stroke extends the minimal amount past the corner necessary to form a convex corner. This acts identically to miter, but forces stroke-miterlimit to behave as if it had its minimum value of 1.

	/// <summary>
	/// Sets the value of the property entry to <c>fallback</c>. When the stroke-miterlimit is exceeded, this behaves as if crop bevel were specified. Can we just remove fallback? It’s a stupid value, useful only because we didn’t have the clip-at-miterlimit behavior in SVG1. Question is if people are mostly just *accidentally* getting the bevel behavior right now, and would be okay with their joins extending up to the miterlimit and only getting the excess corners clipped, or if they actually wanted the discontinuous behavior currently specified. The breakpoint is between 29 and 30 degrees.
