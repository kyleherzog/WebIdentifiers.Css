	/// Sets the value of the property entry to <c>auto</c>. The exact algorithm for selecting which soft wrap opportunity to break at is UA-defined. The algorithm may consider multiple lines when making break decisions. The UA may bias for speed over best layout. The UA must not attempt to even out all lines (including the last) as for balance. This value selects the UA’s preferred (or most Web-compatible) wrapping algorithm.

	/// <summary>
	/// Sets the value of the property entry to <c>balance</c>. Line breaks are chosen to balance the remaining (empty) space in each line box, if better balance than auto is possible. This must not change the number of line boxes the block would contain if text-wrap were set to auto. The remaining space to consider is that which remains after placing floats and inline content, but before any adjustments due to text justification. Line boxes are balanced when the standard deviation from the average inline-size of the remaining space in each line box is reduced over the block (including lines that end in a forced break). The exact algorithm is UA-defined. UAs may treat this value as auto if there are more than ten lines to balance.
