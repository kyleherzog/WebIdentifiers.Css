The border-radius and border-image and box-shadow, if any, are applied to each fragment independently. The background is drawn independently in each fragment of the element. A no-repeat background image will thus be rendered once in each fragment of the element.

The effect is as though the element were rendered with no breaks present, and then sliced by the breaks afterward: no border and no padding are inserted at a break; no box-shadow is drawn at a broken edge; and backgrounds, border-radius, and the border-image are applied to the geometry of the whole box as if it were unbroken.
