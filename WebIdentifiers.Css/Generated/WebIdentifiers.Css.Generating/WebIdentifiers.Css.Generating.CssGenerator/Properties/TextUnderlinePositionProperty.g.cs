This value can be combined with left or right if a particular side is preferred in vertical typographic modes. text-underline-position: under Because text-underline-position inherits, and is not reset by the text-decoration shorthand, the following example switches the document to use under underlining, which can be more appropriate for writing systems with long, complicated descenders. It is also often useful for mathematical or chemical texts that use many subscripts. :root { text-underline-position: under; }
