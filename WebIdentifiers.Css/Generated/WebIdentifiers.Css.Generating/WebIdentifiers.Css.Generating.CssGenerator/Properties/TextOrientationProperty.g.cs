	/// Sets the value of the property entry to <c>mixed</c>. Typographic character units from horizontal-only scripts are typeset sideways, i.e. 90° clockwise from their standard orientation in horizontal text. Typographic character units from vertical scripts are typeset with their intrinsic orientation. See Vertical Orientations for further details. This value is typical for layout of dominantly vertical-script text.

	/// <summary>
	/// Sets the value of the property entry to <c>upright</c>. Typographic character units from horizontal-only scripts are typeset upright, i.e. in their standard horizontal orientation. Typographic character units from vertical scripts are typeset with their intrinsic orientation and shaped normally. See Vertical Orientations for further details. This value causes the used value of direction to be ltr, and for the purposes of bidi reordering, causes all characters to be treated as strong LTR.
