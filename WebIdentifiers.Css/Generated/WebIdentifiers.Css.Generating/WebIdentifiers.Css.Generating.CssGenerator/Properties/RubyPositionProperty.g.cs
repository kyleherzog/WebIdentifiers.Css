	/// Sets the value of the property entry to <c>alternate</c>. Different levels of annotations alternate between over and under. If the annotation container is the first level of annotation in its ruby segment, or if all prior levels are inter-character, then alternate, either on its own or in combination with over, behaves the same as over, while alternate in combination with under behaves the same as under. Otherwise, if the previous level of interlinear annotation is over, alternate behaves like under, and vice versa. (In this case, whether alternate is specified alone or in combination with over or under makes no difference.)

	/// <summary>
	/// Sets the value of the property entry to <c>inter-character</c>. If the writing mode of the enclosing ruby container is vertical, this value has the same effect as over. Otherwise, the ruby annotation becomes an inter-character annotation. The annotation appears on the right of the base in horizontal text. This forces the computed value of writing-mode of the ruby annotation children of this ruby annotation container to be vertical-rl. This value is provided for the special case of traditional Chinese as used especially in Taiwan: ruby (made of bopomofo glyphs) in that context appears vertically along the right side of the base glyph, even when the layout of the base characters is horizontal: “Bopomofo” ruby in traditional Chinese (ruby annotation shown in blue for clarity) in horizontal layout
