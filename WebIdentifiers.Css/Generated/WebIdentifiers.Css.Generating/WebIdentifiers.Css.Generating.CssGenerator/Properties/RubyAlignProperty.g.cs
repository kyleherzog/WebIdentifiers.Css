The ruby content is aligned with the start edge of its box. start ruby distribution &quot;Katatsuki ruby&quot; (肩付きルビ) is close to, but not quite the same as, this start value. In particular, its behavior when overhanging its base can differ from start alignment depending on surrounding context, see JLREQ. Also, it’s only ever used in vertical writing, and the JLTF considers it not particularly important, so it may not be worth the effort to make this value smart enough to deal with katatsuki ruby. If start is needed for some other purpose, we should keep it. Otherwise, maybe just drop it?
