	/// Gets the name of the <c>backwards</c> property. During the period defined by animation-delay, the animation will apply the property values defined in the keyframe that will start the first iteration of the animation. These are either the values of the from keyframe (when animation-direction is normal or alternate) or those of the to keyframe (when animation-direction is reverse or alternate-reverse).

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>forwards</c> property. After the animation ends (as determined by its animation-iteration-count), the animation will apply the property values for the time the animation ended. When animation-iteration-count is an integer greater than zero, the values applied will be those for the end of the last completed iteration of the animation (rather than the values for the start of the iteration that would be next). When animation-iteration-count is zero, the values applied will be those that would start the first iteration (just as when animation-fill-mode is backwards).

	public string Forwards => CssValues.Forwards;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>none</c> property. The animation has no effect when it is applied but not executing.
