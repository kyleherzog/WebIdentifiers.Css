The values 100 to 900 form an ordered sequence, where each number indicates a weight that is at least as dark as its predecessor. The keyword normal is synonymous with 400, and bold is synonymous with 700. Keywords other than normal and bold have been shown to be often confused with font names and a numerical scale was therefore chosen for the 9-value list.
