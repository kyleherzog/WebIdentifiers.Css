This sequence of keywords corresponds to monotonically non-decreasing volume levels, mapped to implementation-dependent values that meet the listener’s requirements with regards to perceived loudness. These audio levels are typically provided via a preference mechanism that allow users to calibrate sound options according to their auditory environment. The keyword x-soft maps to the user’s minimum audible volume level, x-loud maps to the user’s maximum tolerable volume level, medium maps to the user’s preferred volume level, soft and loud map to intermediary values.
