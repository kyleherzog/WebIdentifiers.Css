	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>anywhere</c> property. An otherwise unbreakable sequence of characters may be broken at an arbitrary point if there are no otherwise-acceptable break points in the line. Shaping characters are still shaped as if the word were not broken, and grapheme clusters must stay together as one unit. No hyphenation character is inserted at the break point. Soft wrap opportunities introduced by anywhere are considered when calculating min-content intrinsic sizes. In the case of word-break: auto-phrase, these additional soft wrap opportunities are only introduced if relaxing the restrictions introduced by word-break: auto-phrase as described in overflow-wrap: normal is insufficient to prevent overflow.

	/// Gets the name of the <c>break-word</c> property. As for anywhere except that soft wrap opportunities introduced by break-word are not considered when calculating min-content intrinsic sizes.
	/// </summary>
	public string BreakWord => CssValues.BreakWord;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>normal</c> property. Lines may break only at allowed break points. However, the restrictions introduced by word-break: keep-all may be relaxed to match word-break: normal if there are no otherwise-acceptable break points in the line. Also, the restrictions introduced by word-break: auto-phrase are relaxed if there are no otherwise-acceptable break points in the line: If suppressing soft wrap opportunities within a particular phrase would cause that phrase to overflow even when placed on an otherwise empty line, the user agent must fall back to the same soft wrap opportunities as normal within that phrase. If that is not enough to prevent overflow, suppression of hyphenation opportunities must also be abandoned within each line that would overflow. As an intermediary measure, user agents may also detect multiple levels of phrases, choosing to shorter ones (possibly down to individual words) when longer ones would lead to overflow. The soft wrap opportunities obtained by relaxing the restrictions introduced by word-break: keep-all and word-break: auto-phrase are not considered when calculating min-content intrinsic sizes.
