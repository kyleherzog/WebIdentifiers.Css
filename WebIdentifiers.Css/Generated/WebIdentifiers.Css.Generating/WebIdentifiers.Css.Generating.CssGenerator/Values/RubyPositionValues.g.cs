	/// Gets the name of the <c>alternate</c> property. Different levels of annotations alternate between over and under. If the annotation container is the first level of annotation in its ruby segment, or if all prior levels are inter-character, then alternate, either on its own or in combination with over, behaves the same as over, while alternate in combination with under behaves the same as under. Otherwise, if the previous level of interlinear annotation is over, alternate behaves like under, and vice versa. (In this case, whether alternate is specified alone or in combination with over or under makes no difference.)

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>inter-character</c> property. If the writing mode of the enclosing ruby container is vertical, this value has the same effect as over. Otherwise, the ruby annotation becomes an inter-character annotation. The annotation appears on the right of the base in horizontal text. This forces the computed value of writing-mode of the ruby annotation children of this ruby annotation container to be vertical-rl. This value is provided for the special case of traditional Chinese as used especially in Taiwan: ruby (made of bopomofo glyphs) in that context appears vertically along the right side of the base glyph, even when the layout of the base characters is horizontal: “Bopomofo” ruby in traditional Chinese (ruby annotation shown in blue for clarity) in horizontal layout

	/// Gets the name of the <c>over</c> property. The ruby annotation appears line-over the base. Ruby over Japanese base text in horizontal layout Ruby to the right of Japanese base text in vertical layout

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>under</c> property. The ruby annotation appears line-under the base. This is a relatively rare setting used in ideographic East Asian writing systems, most easily found in educational text. Ruby under Japanese base text in horizontal layout Ruby to the left of Japanese base text in vertical layout
