	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>break-spaces</c> property. The behavior is identical to that of preserve, except that: Any sequence of preserved white space or other space separators always takes up space, including at the end of the line. A soft wrap opportunity exists after every preserved white space character and after every other space separator (including between adjacent spaces).
	/// </summary>
	public string BreakSpaces => CssValues.BreakSpaces;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>collapse</c> property. This value directs user agents to collapse sequences of white space into a single character (or in some cases, no character).
	/// </summary>
	public string Collapse => CssValues.Collapse;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>discard</c> property. This value directs user agents to “discard” all white space in the element. Does this preserve line break opportunities or no? Do we need a distinct "hide" value? If it preserves line break opportunities, maybe it should be replaced with a word-space-transform value?
	/// </summary>
	public string Discard => CssValues.Discard;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>preserve</c> property. This value prevents user agents from collapsing sequences of white space. Segment breaks such as line feeds are preserved as forced line breaks.
	/// </summary>
	public string Preserve => CssValues.Preserve;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>preserve-breaks</c> property. Like collapse, this value collapses consecutive white space characters, but preserves segment breaks in the source as forced line breaks.
	/// </summary>
	public string PreserveBreaks => CssValues.PreserveBreaks;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>preserve-spaces</c> property. This value prevents user agents from collapsing sequences of white space, and converts tabs and segment breaks to spaces. (This value is intended to represent the behavior of xml:space="preserve" in SVG.)
	/// </summary>
	public string PreserveSpaces => CssValues.PreserveSpaces;
