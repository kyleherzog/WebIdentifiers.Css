	/// Gets the name of the <c>economy</c> property. The user agent should make adjustments to the page’s styling as it deems necessary and prudent for the output device. For example, if the document is being printed, a user agent might ignore any backgrounds and adjust text color to be sufficiently dark, to minimize ink usage.

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>exact</c> property. This value indicates that the page is using color and styling on the specified element in a way which is important and significant, and which should not be tweaked or changed except at the user’s request. For example, a mapping website offering printed directions might "zebra-stripe" the steps in the directions, alternating between white and light gray backgrounds. Losing this zebra-striping and having a pure-white background would make the directions harder to read with a quick glance when distracted in a car.
