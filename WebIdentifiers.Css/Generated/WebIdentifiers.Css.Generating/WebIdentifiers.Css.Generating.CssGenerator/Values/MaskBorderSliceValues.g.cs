This property specifies inward offsets from the top, right, bottom, and left edges of the mask border image, dividing it into nine regions: four corners, four edges and a middle. The middle image part is discarded and treated as fully opaque white (the content covered by the middle part is not masked and shines through) unless the fill keyword is present.
