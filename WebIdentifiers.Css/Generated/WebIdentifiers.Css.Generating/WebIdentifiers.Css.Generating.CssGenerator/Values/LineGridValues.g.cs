	/// Gets the name of the <c>create</c> property. Box creates a new line grid using its own font and line layout settings, including any adjustment to the line height caused by the line-height-step property. The line grid consists of a series of horizontal lines corresponding to all the baselines (alphabetic, text-top, text-bottom, mathematic, central, hanging, etc.) and to the line-over and line-under edges, positioned where they would fall if the contents of this element consisted entirely of line boxes filled with text (no sub-elements) using the first available font. If the box is paginated, the line grid is restarted on each page; since line boxes cannot be fragmented, no page begins with the bottom part of a line’s grid.

	/// Gets the name of the <c>match-parent</c> property. Box assumes the line grid of its parent if its writing mode is the same as its parent. If the box has a writing mode that is different than its parent, then the box creates a new line grid as create below.
