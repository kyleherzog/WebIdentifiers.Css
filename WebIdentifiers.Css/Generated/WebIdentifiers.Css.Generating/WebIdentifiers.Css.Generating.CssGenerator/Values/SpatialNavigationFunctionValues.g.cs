	/// Gets the name of the <c>grid</c> property. Moves the focus to the element which is aligned most in the navigation direction. If there are more than one aligned candidates in the navigation direction, select the element with the closest distance along the axis which corresponds to the navigation direction. In case of multiple elements with the same distance, select the element with the minimum amount of alignment. Else if there isn’t any aligned candidate in a given direction, select the element with the closest distance along the axis which corresponds to the navigation direction. In case of multiple elements with the same distance, select the element with the minimum distance along the axis which is orthogonal to the navigation direction.
