	/// Gets the name of the <c>local</c> property. The background is fixed with regard to the element’s contents: if the element has a scrolling mechanism, the background scrolls with the element’s contents, and the background painting area and background positioning area are relative to the scrollable area of the element rather than to the border framing them. Because the scrollable area does not include the border area, for scrollable elements the border-box value of background-clip may be treated the same as padding-box.
