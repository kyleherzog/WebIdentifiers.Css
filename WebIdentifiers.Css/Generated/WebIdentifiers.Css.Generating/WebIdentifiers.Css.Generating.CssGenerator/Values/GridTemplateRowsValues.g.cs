	/// Gets the name of the <c>auto</c> property. As a maximum: represents the largest max-content contribution of the grid items occupying the grid track; however, unlike max-content, allows expansion of the track by the align-content and justify-content properties. As a minimum: represents the largest minimum size (specified by min-width/min-height) of the grid items occupying the grid track. (This initially is often, but not always, equal to a min-content minimum—see § 6.6 Automatic Minimum Size of Grid Items.) When appearing outside a minmax() notation: equivalent to minmax(auto, auto), representing the range between the minimum and maximum described above. (This behaves similar to minmax(min-content, max-content) in the most basic cases, but with extra abilities.)
