	/// Gets the name of the <c>anchor-center</c> property. The new anchor-center value makes this case extremely simple: if the positioned element has a default anchor element, then it is aligned so as to center itself over the default anchor element in the appropriate axis. If this alignment would cause it to overflow its inset-modified containing block in the appropriate axis, it instead is aligned flush with the side that it would have overflowed; if it would overflow both sides, it’s instead aligned as for start.

	public string AnchorCenter => CssValues.AnchorCenter;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>left</c> property. Aligns the alignment subject to be flush with the alignment container’s line-left or physical left edge, whichever is in the appropriate axis. If the property’s axis is not parallel with either left↔right axis, this value behaves as start. Currently, the only case where the property’s axis is not parallel with either left↔right axis is in a column flexbox.
	/// </summary>
	public string Left => CssValues.Left;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>legacy</c> property. This keyword causes the value to effectively inherit into descendants. If the legacy keyword appears on its own (without an accompanying left, right, or center keyword): if the inherited value of justify-items includes the legacy keyword, this value computes to the inherited value; otherwise it computes to normal. When justify-self:auto references the value of justify-items, only the alignment keyword, not the legacy keyword, is referenced by it. It exists to implement the legacy alignment behavior of HTML’s &lt;center&gt; element and align attribute.

	public string Legacy => CssValues.Legacy;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>right</c> property. Aligns the alignment subject to be flush with the alignment container’s line-right or physical right edge, whichever is in the appropriate axis. If the property’s axis is not parallel with either left↔right axis, this value behaves as start. Currently, the only case where the property’s axis is not parallel with either left↔right axis is in a column flexbox.
