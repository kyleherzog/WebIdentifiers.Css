	/// Gets the name of the <c>auto</c> property. The first value gives the width of the corresponding image, the second value its height. If only one value is given the second is assumed to be auto. A percentage is relative to the background positioning area. An auto value for one dimension is resolved by using the image’s natural aspect ratio and the size of the other dimension, or failing that, using the image’s natural size, or failing that, treating it as 100%. If both values are auto then the natural width and/or height of the image should be used, if any, the missing dimension (if any) behaving as auto as described above. If the image has neither natural size, its size is determined as for contain. Negative values are invalid.
