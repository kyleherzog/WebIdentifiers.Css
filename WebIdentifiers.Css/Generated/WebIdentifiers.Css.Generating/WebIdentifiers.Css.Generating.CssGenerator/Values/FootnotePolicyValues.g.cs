	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>line</c> property. If a given footnote body cannot be placed on the current page due to lack of space, the user agent introduces a forced page break at the start of the line containing the footnote reference, so that both the reference and the footnote body fall on the next page. Note that the user agent must honor widow and orphan settings when doing this, and so may need to insert the page break on an earlier line.
