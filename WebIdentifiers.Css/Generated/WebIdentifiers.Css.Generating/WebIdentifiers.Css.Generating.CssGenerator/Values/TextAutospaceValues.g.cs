	/// Gets the name of the <c>ideograph-alpha</c> property. Creates extra spacing between runs of ideographs and non-ideographic letters, see § 8.4.1 Inter-script Spacing.
	/// </summary>

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>ideograph-numeric</c> property. Creates extra spacing between runs of ideographs and non-ideographic numerals, see § 8.4.1 Inter-script Spacing.
	/// </summary>
	public string IdeographNumeric => CssValues.IdeographNumeric;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>insert</c> property. The specified spacing is automatically inserted if there are no space characters of any kind (Unicode general category Z) already there. If neither insert nor replace are specified, the behavior is the same as insert.
	/// </summary>

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>no-autospace</c> property. No automatic space is inserted.

	/// </summary>
	public string Normal => CssValues.Normal;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>punctuation</c> property. Creates extra non-breaking spacing around punctuation as required by language-specific typographic conventions. In this level, if the element’s content language is French, narrow no-break space (U+202F) and no-break space (U+00A0) is inserted where required by French typographic guidelines. Otherwise this value has no effect. However future specifications may add automatic spacing behavior for other languages.
	/// </summary>
	public string Punctuation => CssValues.Punctuation;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>replace</c> property. The specified spacing is automatically inserted even if there is already a space (U+0020) at that point; additionally, the space (U+0020) is removed. Other types of space characters (Unicode general category Z) suppress automatic spacing, as for insert.
