	/// Gets the name of the <c>contain</c> property. This value indicates that the element must not perform non-local boundary default actions such as scroll chaining or navigation. The user agent must not perform scroll chaining to any ancestors along the scroll chain regardless of whether the scroll originated at this element or one of its descendants. This value must not modify the behavior of how local boundary default actions should behave, such as showing any overscroll affordances.

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>none</c> property. This value implies the same behavior as contain and in addition this element must also not perform local boundary default actions such as showing any overscroll affordances.
