	/// Gets the name of the <c>auto</c> property. The offset transform will have a rotation component equal to the difference between the offset path’s direction at the offset position and the direction of the positive X axis (that is, a line going toward the right). See SVG’s direction of a path for details on how to calculate this. If specified with an <angle>, the angle is added to the rotation component.
