	/// Gets the name of the <c>oblique</c> property. A value of normal selects a font that is classified as normal in the UA’s font database, while oblique selects a font that is labeled oblique.

	/// Gets the name of the <c>small-caps</c> property. A value of normal selects a font that is not a small-caps font, small-caps selects a small-caps font. It is acceptable (but not required) in CSS 2 if the small-caps font is a created by taking a normal font and replacing the lower case letters by scaled uppercase characters. As a last resort, uppercase letters will be used as replacement for a small-caps font.
