	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>scroll</c> property. This value indicates that the content is clipped and that if the user agent uses a scrolling mechanism that is visible on the screen (such as a scroll bar or a panner), that mechanism should be displayed for a box whether or not any of its content is clipped. This avoids any problem with scrollbars appearing and disappearing in a dynamic environment. When this value is specified and the target medium is print, overflowing content may be printed.
	/// </summary>
	public string Scroll => CssValues.Scroll;

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the name of the <c>auto</c> property. The behavior of the auto value is user agent-dependent, but should cause a scrolling mechanism to be provided for overflowing boxes.
	/// </summary>
