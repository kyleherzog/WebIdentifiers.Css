	/// Gets the name of the <c>collapse</c> property. Indicates that the box is collapsed, which can cause it to take up less space than otherwise in a formatting-context–specific way. See dynamic row and column effects in tables [CSS2] and collapsed flex items in flex layout [CSS-FLEXBOX-1]. In all other cases, however, (i.e. unless otherwise specified) this simply makes the box invisible, just like hidden.
