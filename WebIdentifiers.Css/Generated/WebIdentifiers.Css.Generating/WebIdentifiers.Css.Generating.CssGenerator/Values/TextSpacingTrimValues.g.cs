	/// Gets the name of the <c>auto</c> property. The user agent chooses a set of typographically high quality spacing values. Different user agents running on different platforms may pick different values. Do we need auto? It would be weird for the author to choose platform-dependent behavior at the start of the first line, and it should otherwise use trim-auto.
