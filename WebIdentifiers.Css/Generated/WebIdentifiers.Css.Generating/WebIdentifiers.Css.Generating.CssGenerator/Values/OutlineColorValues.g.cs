	/// Gets the name of the <c>invert</c> property. the user agent is expected to perform a color inversion on the pixels on the screen. This is a common trick to ensure the focus border is visible, regardless of color background. Conformant UAs may ignore the invert value on platforms that do not support color inversion of the pixels on the screen. If the UA does not support the invert value, then it must reject that value at parse-time, and the initial value of the outline-color property is the currentColor keyword.
